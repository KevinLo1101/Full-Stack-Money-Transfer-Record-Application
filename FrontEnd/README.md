## Frontend

Please remain that version 6.17.0 of "react-router-dom" was used for this project. 

There are a total of 4 pages, including the Transaction history page, address page, transfer page, and wallet page.


In the transaction history page, the page will display all transactions including any new transaction added.

On the address page, the user can select available addresses and transfer the available amount to the address.

In the transfer page, the user address and destinate address will be filled out automatically. All successful and failed transactions will be written in the transaction history.

The wallet page will display the user's address and the remaining funds of the wallet.
